# Running the example script

Make sure you have all the `pip` modules installed before executing the module. We recommend that you install all the pip requirements into a Python `venv` rather than installed them into pip's global space.

Once you have created a virtual environment and installed all the packages, activate the `venv`:
    source bin/activate
    
To run the example (from the top-level directory), run:
    bin/python3 -m schema_generator.schema_generator_usage
