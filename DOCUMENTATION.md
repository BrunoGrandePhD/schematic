# Data Coordinating Center - Data Ingress

Data ingress consists of three main steps documented in detail below:

1. __Dataset transfer__ - depending on dataset size, this step may take anywhere from a few minutes up to multiple hours
2. __Metadata upload__ - depending on amount and diversity of dataset files, this step could take from 10 minutes to a couple of hours
3. __Metadata validation and dataset submission confirmation__ - this step should take less than 30 seconds on a typical internet connection

The chart below provides a high-level overview of the data ingress process.
